## Random Phrase Guessing Game
### Using object classes to make a game

</div>

### Description
A word guessing game that mainly focuses on employing Object Classes.  A random phrase will be chosen and a player will try to guess the letters.

Altered the colors to be more what I preferred. Changed some stylings so that the guessed letters would change font size. Changed the font to something that caught my eye better.

Added some basic animations and included the active phrase in the Game Over screen regardless of if the player wins or loses.
